 # Welcome to Fantasea. :books:
The aim of this app is to replicate a book management and tracker app like GoodReads with the sole emphasis being placed on fantasy books. As of now, the app is in it very first development stages and contains a VERY limited selection of books, but the goal is to work with a wide corpus of fantasy books, ranging from children fantasy to dark fantasy, and many more.

Steps to replicate the db after cloning the project:
1. Create your db on Mongo Atlas.
2. Input your db URI in your .env following the .env.example.
3. Run 'npm run populatedb'
4. Your db has been populated with 38 fantasy books!
